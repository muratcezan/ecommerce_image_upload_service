## Usage

Example Flask route for uploading an image:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from services.image_upload_service import ImageUploadService

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/upload", methods=["POST"])
def upload_image():
    file = request.files.get("file")
    try:
        saved_path = ImageUploadService.save(
            file=file,
            inst_id="123",
            image_type="logo",
            base_folder="static/uploads/institutions"
        )
        return jsonify({"status": "success", "path": saved_path})
    except ValueError as e:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": str(e)}), 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## API Reference

`ImageUploadService.save(file, inst_id, image_type, base_folder="static/uploads/institutions")`

```
